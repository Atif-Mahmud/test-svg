## about

**status:** _A very unstable hobby project. Approach with caution (as you would a goose)._

**parcel** is an experimental virtual machine for WASM written in zig.

The honk is heavily inspired by [wamr](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime).

## how to get started

1. **clone the repo** and dive into the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaggle-tech/parcel
```
