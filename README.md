# honk :goose:

**Status:** _A very unstable hobby project. Approach with caution (as you would a goose)._

The honk is a **h**eterogeneous, **o**bservable, and **n**omadic **k**ernel,
inspired by Lunatic 🌙 and the ERTS 💧 runtimes.

## About

**honk** is an experimental runtime environment
designed for those who love exploring the edge of
what's possible with distributed systems and WASM.
It’s a unique blend of **asynchronous messaging**,
**isolation**, and **extensibility**, all wrapped
in a tiny, efficient kernel.

### Goals
- 🦢 **Heterogeneous**: Mix and match components, nodes, and processes effortlessly.
- 👀 **Observable**: Real-time inspection and debugging for the curious developer.
- 🏃 **Nomadic**: Lightweight and mobile — perfect for a modular and distributed architecture.

---

## Inspiration

This project draws heavily from **Lunatic** and **Erlang’s ERTS**, aiming to bring the best of both worlds into a streamlined, WASM-centric runtime. _Don’t expect stability yet, but do expect plenty of honks!_ 🦆

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repo** and dive into the code.
2. **Experiment** with deploying nodes and processes — see how they communicate.
3. **Share your feedback** (and your favorite goose memes).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honk
