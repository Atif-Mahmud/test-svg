## about

**status:** _A very unstable hobby project. Approach with caution (as you would a goose)._

The **honk** is an experimental runtime environment
designed for those who love exploring the edge of
what's possible with distributed systems and WASM.

The honk is heavily inspired by the ðŸŒ™ [Lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic) runtime and BEAM of the [Erlang RunTime System](https://blog.stenmans.org/theBeamBook/#_erts_and_the_erlang_runtime_system) and libraries from the Elixir ecosystem like [manifold](https://github.com/discord/manifold).

## how to get started

1. **Clone the repo** and dive into the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaggle-tech/honk
```
